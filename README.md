 ### Project Title: HR Data Analysis

 ### Project Overview
 This Class project Data Analysis aims to generate insight into the employees'
 performance over the years. By analysing the various parameters in the data 
 received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then
 enable us to tell compeling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to
 know the best performance from our data.

 ### Data Sources
 The primaary source of data used here is HR Data and this is one 
 of the data sets shared during one of Lita classes during the
Incubator programme.
